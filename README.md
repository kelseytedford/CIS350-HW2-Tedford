## Technical Background

I have taken a couple courses in programming, CIS 160, CIS 161, CIS 162, CIS 335, CIS 360, and various mathematical and statistical courses that have improved my usage of Python, R, and SAS. In all, I am proficient in Python (with the use of Pandas, Matplotlib, and various linear algebra packages), R, SAS, and some SQL and NoSQL databases for queries.
